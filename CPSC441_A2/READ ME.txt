CPSC 441 assignment 2, Fall 2018
The objective of this assignment was to create a client/server in c++, where a client can send a string 
to the server for encoding and another client can then decode the message. The server encodes using some 
basic hash functions chosen before running and then represents the words of the string as hex numbers.
